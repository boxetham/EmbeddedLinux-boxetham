with_load directory: results and plot that I got when repeatedly running a make and make clean command
		     I feel that its weird that the plots followed so closely but I re-ran the
		     the experiment 3 times and kept getting the same results. 

no_load directory: results and plot that I got when letting the program run with nothing else going on
		   Again, I feel that its weird that the plots followed so closely but I re-ran the
		   the experiment 3 times and kept getting the same results. 

in_class directory: These results seemed better. This is what I got when I ran it in class on Friday. 
		    Included because the plot is better than what I got by myself.
