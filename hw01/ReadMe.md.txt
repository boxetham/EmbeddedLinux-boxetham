I did all of the six items including: 

1. installing the latest shipped image on the BeagleBone
2. setting up a host computer with Linux for kernel development
3. gathering all the needed SD cards, cables, etc.
4. installing git on your host 5. signing up for the two beagle Google groups
6. writing a simple Etch-a-sketch program

For (6) the program will output the grid to the console as you move using your key board.
The instructions are as follows (same as what is printed out when you run the program): 

Move by pressing the keyboard button corresponding to the way you 
want to move and then hit enter
Directions: u - up, d - down, r - right, l - left, c - clear the board
The O is where the curser currently is

Looks good.
How do I quit?
Be sure to do a chmod +x on you file so it will execute.
Doesn't look like you can do any size board.

Score:  8/10
