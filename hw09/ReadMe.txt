Folder 2.6: 
With no delay cycles the time from the highest point to the lowest point is 40ns. There is quite a bit of jitter in this signal. 

Folder 5.3: 
There is no jitter in this toggle of the output. The standard deviation is 1.65V. The waveform is very stable it seems like though and it looks just like a rectangular cyclical wave. 

Folder 5.4:
This folder has a picture that shows the slower period of the signal when running the program that manipulates the PWM frequency with shared memory. There does not seem to be jitter here.

Folder 5.5: 
This folder has a picture that shows the speed up from approx 3.6us period to 595ns period. 

Folder 5.9: 
I saw the change of the input here but it never percolated to the output. There was also that weird cyclical part of the input when the input was high. I am not really sure what was going on here and for the sake of time I couldn't invest further.
