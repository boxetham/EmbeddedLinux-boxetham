tempscript - script from before to get temperature from temp sensor. used in demo.py script

demo.py - log data from temp sensor in google sheet listed below. I tried to put the main function
in a while loop to continuously log data which worked but then the program would get hung up and 
trying to control c to stop it also wasn't working and I would have to restart the beaglebone so I 
commented that out again.
